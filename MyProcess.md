# Project Tech Stack - A Rationale

## Frontend

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: These form the fundamental building blocks of any web application. We've chosen to stick with the core web technologies for maximum control and flexibility.

- Bulma CSS: Bulma was selected as our CSS library for the following reasons:
  - **Ease of Use:** Provides well-structured components and a responsive grid, allowing for rapid implementation.
  - **Clean Aesthetics:** Offers a modern and minimalist look, ideal for form-heavy applications.
  - **No JavaScript Dependencies:** Keeps the frontend lightweight and focused.

- Firebase Authentication: Firebase Authentication provides us with:
  - **Simple Integration:** Smoothly connects with our frontend technologies.
  - **Scalability:** Accommodates future growth if needed.
  - **Social Login Options:** Easy to add popular login methods.

## Backend

- Node.js with Express.js: This choice leverages our existing JavaScript knowledge within the frontend, leading to:
  - **Development Efficiency:** A single language across both frontend and backend streamlines development.
  - **RESTful API Ease:** Express.js is a popular and well-suited framework for building REST APIs.
  - **Community Support:** Extensive resources and a large community are available.

- Firebase Firestore: We opted for Firebase Firestore due to:
  - **Firebase Ecosystem:** Seamless compatibility with Firebase Authentication.
  - **NoSQL Flexibility:** Accommodates potentially varied form submissions.
  - **Real-time Capabilities:** Useful if we want to add real-time updates later.

## Overall Considerations

- **Focus on Ease of Implementation:** Our primary goal was to select technologies that enable quick development and a smooth learning curve.
- **JavaScript Ecosystem:** We prioritized staying within the JavaScript world, ensuring a streamlined workflow and minimizing language context switching.
- **Future Scalability:** The chosen technologies provide a solid foundation for potential project expansion.

*Important Note:* This tech stack represents one well-suited approach. Depending on specific project requirements, team expertise, and long-term goals, alternative valid combinations certainly exist.
