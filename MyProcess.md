
Here's a basic process of what I did. I was very short on time so the project will represent that. Hopefully this will give an idea of my process.

1. **Broke down the project into requirements.**
2. **Tackled picking the tech stack.**
   - Auth0 for authentication
   - Vanilla JS and Bulma for frontend
   - Express, MongoDB, Mongoose for backend
   - Netlify, Render for deployment
3. **Created a plan on how I'll tackle it one by one.**
4. **Implemented the user sign-in using Auth0 and got unique emails as the identifier for users.**
5. **Made a front end for survey input.**
6. **Created a back-end with two basic endpoints.**
7. **Tested endpoints.**
8. **Made a viewable front end that displays the user's data.**
9. **Put everything in production and tested again.**
10. **Did this write-up and now I'm going to send the email.**

I didn't have enough time to meet all the requirements.

Here are things I'd do if I had more time:

1. Better error validation.
2. Don't ask for age, always ask for birth date and calculate age.
3. Add metadata and favicon.
4. Add loading widgets in between loads.
5. Better form validation.
6. Use json web-tokens to encrypt data.
7. Use Jest to add test cases.
8. Clean up the code and make it easier to read.
9. Better documentation.
10. Implement prod and dev variables.
11. And much more... There's plenty more to do, if given adequate time.
